I'm passionate about cybersecurity and enjoy tackling real-world challenges through hands-on projects that push me to learn and adapt. Whether it’s digging into vulnerabilities, analyzing threats, or improving security workflows, I’m driven by curiosity and a genuine interest in how things work, and how to protect them. These projects reflect the effort I’ve put into growing my skills and contributing to smarter, more secure systems. Feel free to check them out and see how I approach solving problems in this fast-moving field.
